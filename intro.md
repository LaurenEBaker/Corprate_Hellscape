# Introduction: Joe Marlin

## Joe At-a-Glance

Hey, there! My name is Joe, and it's probably pretty important in the context of this class to lead with the fact that I'm a software professional and have 13+ years in the field.

In specific, I currently work for a consulting firm that was until recently known as *Nexient*, but was recently purchased by and made a subsidiary of NTT Data and renamed to *Launch by NTT*. In my current engagement (which I've been in for the last six months or so), I'm a technical team lead. However in my immediately prior engagement I served as delivery manager.

I've worked in a variety of software roles, including quite a few years building CAD/CAM/CAE automation for Toyota R&D, building sites for the State of New York, and developing line-of-business software for a small engineering firm (for whom I still do freelancing). 

## So why on earth am I here? 

Without beating around the bush, I'm a community college dropout who has been lucky enough to fall into a successful career by dint of being a massive and unrepentent nerd more or less from birth. I'm an autodidact and a huge fan of learning, so when the State of Michigan launched the Reconnect program I decided 'why not finish my associates for fun'?

I guess it's worth mentioning that this means that I'm generally actually working from class. So we'll see how that goes.

## Who am I outside of class?

As mentioned above: A gigantic nerd. I basically had two strong directions in life when I was young: either be a touring musician or be an acadamic at some high-profile engineering school. What I ended up doing was dropping out of school and working a job that I was very lucky to score for a few years. I ended up quitting and spending a few years living in NYC and playing in a band, but ended up meeting a girl, moving back to Michigan, and focusing on the computers thing. So that's my story in a nutshell.

Even outside of work, my major hobby is computers and specifically retro/vintage computer collecting. I'm a regular attendee of the Vintage Computer Festival Midwest, which is an awesome gathering in Chicago of some of the weirdest, smartest people in the region. Recently, my major project related to VCF is the construction of hardware and software that transforms old games consoles into 'just a PC' -- basically as some sort of obscure tech joke. Right now I'm specifically focusing on the NES and was semi-regularly streaming my progress [over on my YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/trackzerofutzin) (warning, some swears).

If you have any interest, you can find my github (all full of mostly really weird stuff) over at [github.com/JMarlin](https://github.com/JMarlin).

OK thanks byeeeeee
