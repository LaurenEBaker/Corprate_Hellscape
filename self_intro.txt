My name is Lauren Baker and I’m in my second to last semester at WCC. My plan is to transfer to Eastern to get my Bachelor’s in Computer Science and work my way towards becoming a grounds controller for NASA. In my free time I enjoy playing Dungeons and Dragons, playing with my dog – Thor –, Rock climbing, playing volleyball, and doing something related to Halloween. I’m very active and outgoing, I enjoy other people’s company and working on complex jobs, since I like a challenge.
