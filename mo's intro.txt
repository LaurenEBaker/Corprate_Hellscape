Hello my name is Mo I’ve been in the java program at wcc for 3 years now,
this is my last semester and I plan on attending eastern next semester to pursue a bachelors degree.
I enjoy outdoor activities in the summer like kayaking, tennis, hiking, soccer.
And play a lot of video games and watch movies during the cold winters.
