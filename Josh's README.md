Hi all my name is Joshua but most people call me Josh. I plan to transfer to EMU to complete my bachelor’s degree next year. I have an interest in game development, app development, and maybe mobile development. I also like looking into cryptography as well. My most used languages are Python and Java and my most disliked language is C programming (2nd language I learned). I’m a dog person but I also love cats thanks to my friend’s cat she is mean but sweet. I hope to get a cat by next year at the latest.
